# Expense-Tracker
I create an expense tracker that will take details of our expenses. A person will also need to fill in the details about the income and the amount he/she wants to save. Some people earn on a daily basis, so their income can also be added on a regular basis. Details of expenses will be shown in the form of a doughnut chart. Installation of node is a must to start with the Expense Tracker project.
